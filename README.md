# Landing_Page
## Description
Welcome to the **Nebula Boutique Landing Page** project! This is my first venture into using CSS Flexbox for layout design. The goal of this project is to create a stylish landing page for a fictional boutique named **Nebula Boutique**. 


Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my growing skills in web development, particularly in HTML and CSS, with a focus on modern layout techniques.
